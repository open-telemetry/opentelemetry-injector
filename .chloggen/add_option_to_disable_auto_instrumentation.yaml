change_type: enhancement
component: injection
note: Add option to disable auto-instrumentation for specific runtimes or all runtimes
issues: [240]
subtext: When the config file option `auto_instrumentation_disabled` or the environment variable
  `OTEL_INJECTOR_AUTO_INSTRUMENTATION_DISABLED` is set to `*`, auto-instrumentation for all runtimes will be disabled.
  When set to a comma-separated list of runtimes, auto-instrumentation for the listed runtimes will be disabled.
  In contrast to `OTEL_INJECTOR_DISABLED=true` which disables the injector wholesale, injection of additional resource
  attributes via `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` still happens when `auto_instrumentation_disabled` or
  `OTEL_INJECTOR_AUTO_INSTRUMENTATION_DISABLED` are used.
