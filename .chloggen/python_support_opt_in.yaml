component: python
note: Add opt-in support for Python auto-instrumentation
issues: [216]
subtext: |
  Add support for prepending to PYTHONPATH to enable Python auto-instrumentation. For now, auto-instrumentation for
  Python is off by default and no default Python auto-instrumentation agent is included in the system packages.
  Python auto-instrumentation needs to be enabled explicitly by providing a Python auto-instrumentation agent and a
  custom otelinject.conf file with python_auto_instrumentation_agent_path_prefix set or by setting
  PYTHON_AUTO_INSTRUMENTATION_AGENT_PATH_PREFIX.
  Be aware that it is not always safe to inject the existing zero-code instrumentation for Python due to possible
  dependency conflicts (protobuf etc.)
